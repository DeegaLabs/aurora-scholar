# Aurora Scholar - Pitch

> Presentation script for Solana Student Hackathon

## Main Script (3 minutes)

### 0:00 - 0:20 | Problem

**Speech:**
"Today, teachers and institutions face a major challenge: how to know if an academic text was really written by the student?

Students use AI without understanding the ethical implications. Scientific production is losing authenticity. And there is no transparent way to prove who wrote what and when."

**Visual:**
- Slide showing AI usage statistics
- Visual problem: doubt about authenticity

---

### 0:20 - 1:00 | Solution

**Speech:**
"Our project, Aurora Scholar, solves this through **Assisted Academic Writing Monitoring** — an academic editor with ethical AI that monitors and guides, but never writes. The system registers the final article on Solana blockchain, ensuring authenticity, authorship, and transparency.

The student declares their initial idea, uploads their sources, writes their own content with AI guidance, and when finished, the system registers an immutable hash on Solana — including the hash of their declared intuition — proving who wrote, when, and what AI was allowed to do."

**Visual:**
- Show editor interface
- Show authenticity indicator
- Highlight that AI doesn't write, only guides

---

### 1:00 - 1:50 | Why Solana

**Speech:**
"We chose Solana for three main reasons:

First, speed. Fast and cheap transactions allow registering articles without prohibitive costs.

Second, public and verifiable proof. Anyone can verify an article's authenticity by checking the hash on the blockchain.

Third, on-chain ethical governance. Our future vision includes an academic DAO where teachers and universities define ethical guidelines in a decentralized way."

**Visual:**
- Cost comparison (Solana vs other blockchains)
- Example of verification on Solana Explorer
- DAO diagram (future)

### 1:50 - 2:40 | Demo

**Speech:**
"Now I'll demonstrate the complete flow:

[LIVE DEMO]

1. Here is the editor. The student writes their academic article.
2. They can upload sources — PDFs, videos, audios.
3. When they need help, they click 'Ask AI Guidance'. See: the AI suggests improvements, but doesn't write the text.
4. When finished, the student chooses to publish as public or private.
5. The system uploads to Arweave and registers the hash on Solana.
6. See here: the hash is registered on-chain. We can verify on Solana Explorer.
7. Public articles appear in our On-Chain Academic Journal.
8. Private articles can be shared with expiration — 24h, 7 days, 30 days or unlimited."

**Visual:**
- Shared screen showing:
  - Editor with text being written
  - AI returning suggestions
  - Publication process
  - Hash on Solana Explorer
  - On-Chain Journal with published article

### 2:40 - 3:00 | Future Vision and Closing

**Speech:**
"This is just the first step. Our future vision includes:

Custom agents based on authors — users can create a 'Paulo Freire Agent' or 'Kant Agent' that guides according to specific theoretical lines.

An academic DAO where users and institutions govern ethical guidelines in a decentralized way.

Gamified trails that teach ethics in AI use.

And a sustainability model through AI freemium — maintaining basic free access, but allowing users who need more resources to pay a subscription. This ensures the platform is sustainable without excluding those who can't pay.

Aurora Scholar is the first step toward an internet with human, transparent, and ethical content. It's simple, fast, transparent, and designed for the education of the future.

Thank you!"

## Short Version (30 seconds)

**Speech:**
"Teachers don't know if students really wrote their texts. Aurora Scholar solves this through Assisted Academic Writing Monitoring — an editor with ethical AI that monitors and guides, never writes. Articles are registered on Solana with immutable hashes including declared intuition. Articles can be public in our On-Chain Journal or private with temporary access. It's transparent, verifiable, and designed for the education of the future."

## Long Version (5 minutes)

### 0:00 - 0:30 | Detailed Problem

**Speech:**
"The problem we face is triple:

First, the authenticity crisis. With the advancement of generative AI, it has become almost impossible to distinguish between human text and machine-generated text. Teachers spend hours trying to identify plagiarism or improper AI use.

Second, lack of transparency. There is no public and verifiable way to prove when a work was written, by whom, and if it was altered later.

Third, the ethical issue. Students use AI without understanding the implications, and there are no tools that guide them in the ethical use of these technologies."

### 0:30 - 1:30 | Complete Solution

**Speech:**
"Aurora Scholar is a complete platform that solves these three problems:

1. **Editor with Three-Layer Ethical System**: The student declares their initial intuition, uploads declared sources, and writes their own content. The AI doesn't write for them — it only guides, suggests improvements, explains concepts, monitors coherence, and alerts when text seems too automated. It's a monitor, not a writer.

2. **On-Chain Registration**: When the student finishes, the system generates SHA-256 hashes of the content and declared intuition, uploads to Arweave (permanent storage) and registers both hashes plus AI scope on Solana. This creates an immutable proof of authorship, timestamp, and what AI was allowed to do.

3. **On-Chain Academic Journal**: Public articles appear in a permanent and transparent digital journal. Anyone can verify authenticity by checking the hash on the blockchain.

4. **Access Control**: Private articles can be shared with advisors for a limited time — 24h, 7 days, 30 days or unlimited. Access is verified on-chain."

### 1:30 - 2:30 | Why Solana (Detailed)

**Speech:**
"We chose Solana for technical and strategic reasons:

**Speed and Cost**: Solana processes thousands of transactions per second at minimal costs. This allows registering articles without making the process prohibitive for students.

**Transparency**: Every transaction is public and verifiable. Anyone can check Solana Explorer and verify when an article was registered, by which wallet, and what the content hash is.

**Ecosystem**: Solana has a robust ecosystem of educational tools and is heavily investing in onboarding new users — exactly what we need to bring students to Web3.

**Future Governance**: Our vision includes an academic DAO where teachers, universities, and researchers vote on ethical guidelines. Solana offers the perfect tools for decentralized governance."

### 2:30 - 4:00 | Complete Demo

**Speech:**
"I'll demonstrate the complete flow:

[DETAILED DEMO]

1. **Editor**: Clean interface, Google Docs style. The student writes normally.

2. **Declared Sources**: They upload PDFs, links, videos, audios as declared sources. The AI processes, vectorizes, and uses **only** these declared sources as reference — never generates beyond them.

3. **AI Assistant**: When they need help, they click 'Ask Guidance'. See: the AI returns structure suggestions, references, grammatical corrections. But never writes the complete text.

4. **Publication**: When finished, they choose public or private. If private, sets expiration.

5. **On-Chain Process**: The system uploads to Arweave — see the progress. Then registers on Solana — here is the transaction being confirmed.

6. **Verification**: We can verify the hash on Solana Explorer. Anyone can do this.

7. **On-Chain Journal**: Public articles appear here. We can filter, search, view.

8. **Private Access**: If private, the student receives a link they can share. Access expires automatically."

### 4:00 - 5:00 | Future Vision and Impact

**Speech:**
"This is just the MVP. Our future vision is much bigger:

**Custom Agents**: Students will be able to create agents based on authors — a 'Paulo Freire Agent' that guides according to critical pedagogy, or a 'Kant Agent' that helps with moral philosophy. Each agent has its own sources, ethical limits, and thinking style.

**Academic DAO**: Teachers, universities, and researchers will govern ethical guidelines in a decentralized way. This creates a 'decentralized ethics' of knowledge.

**Gamified Trails**: Students will go through educational trails about ethics in AI use, scientific research, methodology. Upon completion, they earn badges and educational tokens.

**Zero-Knowledge Compatibility**: Our architecture is designed to be ZK-compatible, enabling future verification of authenticity and compliance without revealing sensitive content.

**Impact**: Aurora Scholar is not just a tool — it's a new protocol for academic authorship. We ensure knowledge is human, transparent, and verifiable.

Why does this matter for Solana? Student onboarding — the hackathon's main goal. Formation of new developers. Creation of a permanent educational ecosystem on blockchain.

Aurora Scholar is the future of academic publishing. Thank you!"

## Frequently Asked Questions (Q&A)

### "How do you ensure AI doesn't write for the student?"
**Answer:** We implement rigorous validation in the backend. The AI receives specific ethical prompts that prohibit complete writing. Additionally, we validate the response before returning to the user. If the AI tries to write complete text, we reject and request a new response.

### "Why not use IPFS instead of Arweave?"
**Answer:** Arweave offers guaranteed permanence with single payment. IPFS requires continuous pinning. For academic content that needs to last decades, Arweave is more suitable. Additionally, Irys has native integration with Solana.

### "How does the DAO you mention work?"
**Answer:** It's part of Phase 2 of the roadmap. Teachers and universities will have governance tokens to vote on ethical guidelines. These guidelines will be automatically applied by the editor. It's a future vision that shows the potential of decentralized governance.

### "What's the cost for a student to publish?"
**Answer:** In MVP, we use devnet so it's free. On mainnet, the cost would be minimal — less than $0.01 per article due to Solana's efficiency. Upload to Arweave has a one-time cost of a few cents.

### "How do you plan to scale?"
**Answer:** The architecture is prepared for scale. We use Arweave for content (scales automatically) and Solana for metadata (thousands of TPS). PostgreSQL caches frequent queries. The monorepo structure facilitates maintenance and evolution.
